# VHDL-Components

This repository is filled with basic VHDL code that was used in college class.
If these help you then by all means borrow them but I dont intend to maintain these components.
All of these components were used for and by the Basys3 development board by Digilent. I will provide the master file as well for this board.
"Wrappers" will also be added for these components and projects as a reference on how to make one, see .xdc files (A wrapper is used as a translation layer between the generic VHDL code and the physical board).
Test Bench (file name ending _tb.vhdl) will also be provided, they are not amazing but can be used to test the components and helped me debug the issues I had while developing the code.

Thank you for visiting and good luck on your jurney with VHDL!!!

P.S.: The .json file is a script for VScode to make typing faster. And all of these were developed and dested with normal non proprietary libraries but were compiled/built in Vivado 20.2 (all code was writen in 2022 from Jan to May)
